            He is the best boy. He's honestly probably one of the best cats out there.

        <p>And you know what? Soul Patch is a stylish male and he has a <i>lot</i> of self-respect.</p>

            <h2>
                Get to know Soul Patch...
            </h2>
            <p>Soul Patch is a man of many interests: from sleeping on the bed, to lounging on the back of the couch, to
                sleeping under the bed.</p>
            <p>
                He's been known to walk nervously towards the kitchen at the sound of a can opening. He might tiptoe
                towards the litter box if he thinks he
                won't be seen and there are no guests.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="great-qualities">
            <h2>
                ... the best boy.
            </h2>
            <p>
                While Soul Patch gets nervous around strangers, loud noises, and fast movements, he is quite
                affectionate towards those he loves. The best
                part of Soul Patch is his snugs, when he cuddles up next to one of his humans on the couch or in bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soul Patch may also be a fierce hunter. Or at least that's what his family believes about him, because
                we have heard the chattering sounds he makes when watching birds fly by outside the window. He is the
                most terrifying boy who's terrified of everything.
